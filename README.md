# saw2023-ctf-challenge-2
This repository contains the most bleeding edge security for conventietly and securely storing passwords

## How to use
I've conventiently provided a [jar file](https://github.com/jamesratzlaff/saw2023-ctf-challenge-2/releases) that can get you the password BUT you also need to have the code from the [PrivateParts repo](https://github.com/jamesratzlaff/saw2023-ctf-challenge-2-PrivateParts).  Aside from that to figure out how to use it you'll need to take a look at the source code.  I am not here to hold your hand. There is literally a single public method that can be used in this library to get passwords.

## How do I get access to the PrivateParts repo?
That's the neat thing, you don't (unless you're part of the app dev team)
